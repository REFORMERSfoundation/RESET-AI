COMPLEXITY REDUCTION  -techniques from P=NP theorem.

It is possible and plausible to reduce the complexity of nonlinear systems brought to ML, 
for example our P = NP theorem allows this feat by treating nonlinear differential equations 
in terms of linear differential equations. 

More to the point, the choice of equations must be as small and precise as possible to avoid 
equations system scaling complexity.



LEARNABILITY AND UNPROVABILITY

Machine learning and deep learning are solely dependent on the foundation of mathematics, 
not everything can be proven, not even by a futuristic advanced AI system. 

Learnability and compression brings forth a new class of a wide range and variety of 
learning problems, limiting further progress to create AGI, so it appears.


HIGHER ORDER G√ñDEL PROGRAM MODEL  -well structured knowledge.

G”ßdel teaches us that there exist some theorems AI cannot prove moreover, there exist some 
mathematical functions AI cannot execute.

To replace embedding very large sets of facts and data:

0 BASE  -bedrock repositories fundamental knowledge. 

Retrieval system connected directly to our supply chain hosting reliable and secure auxiliary 
specialized information repositories, repositories which have been prior scrutinized by our 
specialized orale which feeds our three value logic theorem prover algorithm.


1 FIRST LAYER  -essential for higher cognition.

Procedural model mechanisms based on covert mathematical principles beyond input-to-output 
observable statistical correlations, this extends the power of cognition beyond ML and DL.


2 G√ñDEL MODEL  -higher level cognition model. 

With a model of incompleteness theorems clearly stating ‚Äúùúì ‚ä¨ ùúô‚Äù will encompass and capture the 
genius of Kurt G”ßdel in proving the fundamentals of undecidable propositions in formal systems, 
as opposed to the purely statistical correlation function extracted from multiple tests.


THEORY OF CONCEPTS  -mathematics & logic concepts.

Ultimate stronghold of the first exact mathematical philosophy, which chooses to view the world 
as an orderly and purposely whole. 

i  Abstract: concept to concept relations and interactions.
ii  Rationalistic: knowable logic universals, sharp mathematical concepts and governing axioms. 
iii   Dynamic contextual adaptation: complex hyper adaptive systems. 


It is evident that there exists a deeply rooted dichotomy embedded in the nature and behavior of 
non-extensional paradoxes. 

This fact leads to yet another hierarchy:

Set   _______________________________________   Element   _________________________________   Number  
Set of set   ________________________________   Elements   ________________________________   Numbers     
Set of set of set   _________________________   Elements of elements   ____________________   Numbers 

Operation   _________________________________   Symbol   __________________________________   Function     
Operation of operation   ____________________   Symbols   _________________________________   Functions 
Operation of operation of operation  ________   Symbols string   __________________________   Functional


The latter hierarchy dictates that sets or numbers are more powerful than rules of inference or 
operations, because numbers are the building blocks of mathematics, particularly prime numbers. 

The intricate interplay of numbers with operations is needed to create even the simplest formulas 
such as 1+2=3 and evidently we arrive at the concept of formula, which is structured as follows:

Concept   ___________________________________   Basic symbol  _____________________________   Formula    
Concept of concept   ________________________   Series of symbols   _______________________   Formulas    
Concept of concept of concept   _____________   Series of series of symbols   _____________   Proof


The abstract character of the conception of concept  is evidence of ontological origins. 
By this we mean, concepts are eternally present in the Platonic realm and they exist independently 
from our mental awareness, definitions and constructions, and for this reason only the relations 
and properties among concepts  are the prescribed method to address them.

Concepts do not need language, for they possess a far more remote ancestry than language. 
Humans utilize language in attempts to describe, communicate and understand phenomena. 
Concepts do not need language to exist, while language is preceded by and is dependent upon concepts.


METHODOLOGY OF THE SCIENCE

In the far left column below, we utilize the mathematical formulas described by propositions I-VII 
in the chronological order of G√∂del‚Äôs incompleteness theorems. 
In the middle column we recast G√∂del‚Äôs ontological proof, we also substituted the word God  with the 
word concept as we believe G√∂del‚Äôs true intent was to prove the theory of concepts by ontological means. 

The far right column is a compendium of G√∂del‚Äôs consistency of the continuum hypothesis, in which the 
more general terms are casted into a large formal system. 
Combined, the three columns provide a system to explain emergence of deep knowledge structures from 
individual concepts.
